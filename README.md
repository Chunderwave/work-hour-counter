# work-hour-counter

Development thoughts
1. Add calendar function in the web so that I can select a date and have the total hours in that week returned to me. 

2. Add group function so that I can use the counter to store hours for different jobs. Each group is one object store in indexedDB
    a. adding new fields to Session class
    b. adding tags function and "create new tag" function

3. Allow deletion of session data, so separate end button with upload data task
